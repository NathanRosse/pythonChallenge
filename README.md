Big thanks to David Chao for his tutoring session that helped immensely

Using what I got from PyBank for PyPoll helps about 30%-40% but I still need to figure out the guts of PyPoll

Thanks to my friend Alex for being my Rubber Duck and helping comprehend why and how I am doing things. And in his words "wow dude this is really baby's first code"

Looked at some code online but my tutor and friends helped for almost all of it
